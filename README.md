This is the repository for my Mod for minecraft 1.13, with the help of the Rift Modding API.

Planned features:

* Magic System

* New Logs, Woods, Planks
* New Foods
* New Crops
* New Tools/More Tools


Disclaimer:
Some of the item textures are taken from Itembound, so I'll put a link to this awesome resource pack here:
