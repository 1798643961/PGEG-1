###Recipe Compat###
Can Wand/Staff/Cauldron recipes be shown in AEI?

###RuneLexicon###
Make Rune Encyclopedia from Spellbook
Place Runes with certain effects on the floor, use inventory materials for it (redstone, mana dust, glowstone,...)
Activate a rune with a Wand/Staff of min LVL that book or effect needs, and pay Mana Cost
Runes vanish after some time, or need to be reactivated, maybe the lvl makes it stay longer

###Runes Effects on contact with connected Dust###
Water (drowning damage)
Fire (Fire damage)
Binding (stay in place, only one mob per dust occupied block?)
Damage (physical damage, duh)
Ice (slowness effect)
Plant (poison effect)
Earth (Dig 4 Deep Hole, 2x2x4?)
Air (jump up, like on a slimeblock)

End (teleport --> maybe special, rune in the middle, dust around makes a teleport point, connected to all others, maybe colored dust to differentiate?)

###Mana Dust###
Placable Mana Dust, if Placed checks for adjacent rune, gives the line of dust the effect of the rune
woking indicated by low lighting?

###Basic Spell Events###
Spawn Entity (a Fireball should fall into this too, right? xD)
Spawn Block
Spawn Item
Inflict Damage on target
Inflict (potion) effect on target
Mine Block
Destroy Block
Transform Block
Teleport Entity/Player

###Basic Spell Json Structure###
Spell Name
associated Item (Spell Scroll e.g. Fireball)
min Staff lvl
Basic Spell Event
	Target
	Output
Sound
Particle Effect
Mana Cost

###Spellbrewing Cauldron###
needs heat source underneath
crafted via Wand (min lvl 1) from Vanilla Cauldron
recipe system with inputs (maybe in order, but not neccessarily) and outputs in jsons
clicking with a wand finishes a cauldron recipe?

###Spellbinding Table###
crafted via Wand from enchantment table
needs mana dust to operate
used to bind Spells to Wands

	###Spellbook###
	IF Spells get bound to Wands/Staffs, change Spellbook to Almanac of Mysticism and Magic (Mod Documentation)

###Spells on Wands/Staffs###
lvl of wand/staff gives max number of saved spells
maybe two classes wands/staffs (wands less mana cost, but staffs more "power" or another benefit?)

###Magic Flowers in Pots###
Flower Pot with blue Flower --> Snowbell (produces snow around itself)
Flower Pot with Mushroom --> Glowshroom (produces light)

###Additional Ores###
Mithril (light blue, stronger than diamond, generates near bedrock/compound of Iron, ManaDust and Diamond?)
Orichalcum (red/pink, faster underwater, strong as diamond, generates in deep Oceans)
Saturnium (dark blue/purple, random enchantments on crafted tools andd weapons, generates in the End, stronger than Obsidian)
Brimstone (black stone/yellow ore, smelting on tools?, burn on weapons?, fire resistance on armor?, as stronger than Diamond, generates in the Nether)
Meteorite (stronger than Saturnium, randomly spawns in Meteorite structures (balls made of obsidian?))

###Ore Strenghts###
Wood
Stone
Iron / Emerald
Diamond / Mithril / Orichalcum
Obsidian / Brimstone
Saturnium
Meteorite

###Additional Materials (Tools/Weapons)###
Obsidian (stronger than Diamond)
Emerald (as strong as Iron, high enchantability)

###Plants/Crops###
Tomato
Rice
Cotton
Berry Bush

###Food###
Sushi
Squid Tentacles (raw/cooked)
Berries
Caramel
Caramel Apple
Candy (maybe with Potion effects)
Cheese
Caprese (Mozarella and Tomato)
Pizza
Dough
Jerky (Monster, Mutton, Squid, Fish, Pork,...) [maybe a drying rack, like tinkers consstruct has]
